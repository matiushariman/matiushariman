### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matius. Iâ€™m an Indonesian-born Singapore permanent resident and a former senior frontend engineer at Gojek.

I have always been passionate about software programming since I was a kid, starting from the day I used to play around with Visual Basic back in secondary school. There is something about computer programming, specifically front-end engineering that always excites me. Seeing how lines of code work in harmony on the screen, knowing what I help create can be enjoyed by hundreds of thousands or million users, and that it can help change the world for the better, those are things that always give me a sense of achievement and most importantly happiness.
