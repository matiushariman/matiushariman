### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matius. Iâ€™m an Indonesian-born Singapore permanent resident and a former senior frontend engineer at Gojek.

I started my web development journey in 2016 with [BAMBU](https://bambu.co/), where I was fortunate enough to be part of the co-founding members of the awards winning team on a mission to provide next-gen wealth management solutions for financial institutions worldwide.

After almost 6 years worth of rewarding adventure in the startup world, I moved onto my next journey to build digital economy of the future in one of the world's largest economies with [Gojek](https://www.gojek.com/en-id/). Unfortunately, [my venture was cut short along with 1,299 others](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/indonesia-goto-cut-1300-jobs-gojek-retrench-tech-firms-ride-hailing-3083101)
due to 2022-present macroeconomic situation. While looking for the next big thing, I spend most of my days learning new things, building side projects, and of course, catching the Celtics game whenever I can. Go C's!
